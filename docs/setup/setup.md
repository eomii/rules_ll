# Setup

This guide explains how to set up `rules_ll`.

??? "System requirements"

    `rules_ll` makes heavy use of upstream dependencies. Staying upstream
    sometimes means that backwards-incompatible changes make it into `rules_ll`
    faster than into other toolchains. Because of this `rules_ll` won't work on
    some older systems.

    Prerequisites:

    - An `x86_64` processor. You can verify this with `uname -a`.
    - A Linux kernel with 64-bit support. You can verify this with
      `getconf LONG_BIT`.
    - As a rough guideline, at least 10 GB of disk space for fetched
      dependencies and build artifacts. Using all toolchains, debug and
      optimization modes might require more than 30 GB of disk space. If the
      build cache gets too large over time you can reset it using the
      `bazel clean` and `bazel clean --expunge` commands.
    - As a rough guideline, at least 1 GB of Memory per CPU core. The `nproc`
      command prints the number of CPU cores for your system.

    Additionally, if you use the legacy setup:

    - A `glibc` version that supports `mallinfo2`. Verify that `ldd --version`
      prints a value of at least `2.33`.
    - A functional host toolchain for C++. Some distributions have this by
      default, others require manual installation of a recent version of Clang
      or GCC. This toolchain compiles the upstream versions of Clang and
      clang-tidy used by `ll_*` targets.
    - For Nvidia GPU toolchains, a GPU with compute capability of at least
      `5.2`. This applies to 10xx series GPUs and up, and some `9xx` series
      GPUs. You can find a list of compute capabilities at
      <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus>.

1. Install the [nix package manager](https://nixos.org/download.html) and enable
   [flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes).

2. Create a `rules_ll` compatible workspace. This project moves fast and often
   introduces breaking changes. To keep the development shell in sync with the
   `rules_ll` module in `bzlmod`, pin the flake to a specific version:

    ```bash
    nix flake init -t github:eomii/rules_ll/<version>
    ```

    The default toolchains include C++ and HIP for AMDGPU. If you also want to
    target NVPTX devices (Nvidia GPUs), make sure to read the [CUDA license](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/eula/index.html)
    and set `unfree = true` in `flake.nix`.

    See [tags](https://github.com/eomii/rules_ll/tags) to find the most recent
    version.

3. Enter a `rules_ll` development shell:

    ```bash
    nix develop
    ```

See [`rules_ll/examples`](https://github.com/eomii/rules_ll/tree/main/examples)
for examples. The [Guides](https://ll.eomii.org/guides) explain more advanced
features of `rules_ll` such as Clang-Tidy, C++ modules, and heterogeneous
programming.

## Legacy setup

1. Install [bazelisk](https://bazel.build/install/bazelisk).

2. Create the following files:

```python title="WORKSPACE.bazel"
# Empty.
```

```title=".bazelversion"
--8<-- ".bazelversion"
```

```python title="MODULE.bazel"
--8<-- "examples/MODULE.bazel::1"
```

```python title=".bazelrc"
--8<-- ".bazelrc"
```

You can now load the `ll_library` and `ll_binary` rule definitions in your
`BUILD.bazel` files like this:

```python
load("@rules_ll//ll:defs.bzl", "ll_library", "ll_binary")
```

See [`rules_ll/examples`](https://github.com/eomii/rules_ll/tree/main/examples)
for examples. The [Guides](https://ll.eomii.org/guides) explain more advanced
features of `rules_ll` such as Clang-Tidy, C++ modules, and heterogeneous
programming.
